### Simple Online Multiplayer Networking Dedicated Authoritative Server



A simple Godot multiplayer setup. Change the IP address to your cloud service and compile and upload it as a Linux headless version. The clients will connect automatically to the server. The server has full authority; the player can only send inputs to prevent cheating. The server is the only one able to see the player's inputs. The server picks a random map. The server will spawn the clients and search for the nodes in the spawn area group, choose one randomly, get its dimension and set a random position inside the area.
